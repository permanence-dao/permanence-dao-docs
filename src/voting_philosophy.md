## Voting Philosophy

Permanence DAO evaluates treasury proposals on a **per-case basis**. By leveraging the diverse expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives of its professional members from fields such as business development, infrastructure, software development, and the creative industries, the DAO aims to arrive at solid and fair evaluations of proposals.

Each core member holds **equal voting power**, and has **full autonomy** in governance decisions while adhering to the DAO’s core values for guidance:

1. **Integrity:** We preserve our integrity through a strong commitment to our values, cultivating stability and reliability.

2. **Transparency:** We promote accountability and trust by focusing on transparency in our direction, decision-making, and resource management.

3. **Neutrality:** We are unbiased in our decision-making, evaluating opportunities primarily concerning the network’s well-being and long-term interests.

4. **Merit:** We seek merit and a proven track record in the teams and individuals we support or work with, incentivizing competence.

5. **Sustainability:** We acknowledge the unique value offered by the networks we operate in, and we work to sustain and enhance this value for the long term.

6. **Creativity:** We promote an environment where a multidisciplinary creative energy of arts, crafts, and technology flows freely and comes to fruition.

7. **Openness:** We remain flexible and open-minded, aiming for exploration through experimentation. We embrace criticism and challenge our assumptions.

### Conflict of Interest

Any member with a **direct or indirect connection to a proposal must abstain** from voting on the related referendum.
