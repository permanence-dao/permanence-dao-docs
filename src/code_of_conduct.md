## Code of Conduct

### Dos and Donts

This section provides a brief overview of the expectation and guidelines for the core members of Permanence DAO. Core members include the ten initial members and those who were voted into the DAO. Core members are “the face and the brand” of Permanence DAO.

#### Dos:

1. **Actively Participate:** Core members should engage proactively in the Telegram/Discord group. There are no specific benchmarks or rules for participation, but if you choose not to engage without justification, other core members may propose your removal from the DAO.

2. **Represent Professionally:** Always represent Permanence DAO positively and professionally online, at events, and in all forms of communication.

3. **Follow Telegram/Discord Chat Rules:** Always follow both the private and public rules of behavior outlined below.

4. **Stay Active:** Maintain continuous involvement in the program. Inactivity for over a month may result in demotion or removal. Members who need or want to take a break can do so without being removed, with the conditions of the break evaluated by DAO members.

5. **Adhere to the Code of Conduct:** Follow the Code of Conduct and consistently demonstrate respectful and inclusive behavior.

6. **Delegation of Core Members:** All core members must have a minimum delegation to Permanence DAO. See the approved internal referendum for details.

#### Don'ts:

1. **Do Not Violate the Code of Conduct:** Avoid any behavior that goes against the program's Code of Conduct, including disrespectful or discriminatory actions.

2. **Do Not Spread Misinformation:** Ensure all information shared about Permanence DAO is accurate and aligned with the latest official updates.

3. **Do Not Represent Without Authorization:** Avoid entering into partnerships on behalf of Permanence DAO without proper authorization or approval from a majority of core members.

4. **Do Not Engage in Conflicts of Interest:** Maintain transparency in all actions and avoid activities that could present a conflict of interest.

### Private Telegram/Discord Chat Rules

Core members have a private Telegram/Discord group for communication. All core members must read and adhere to the following rules to keep the group friendly, welcoming, professional, and on-topic.

1. Trolling and personal attacks will not be tolerated. This includes provoking individuals, threats of violence, or vulgar remarks towards individuals. Depending on the nature of the offense, this may result in a warning or ban. A majority (>50%) of core members must vote  to ban a member from the chat(s).

2. Remain on-topic; our topics have a specific context and the conversations should remain relevant. Channels should not be used to draw attention to alternative groups.

3. Baseless/fake representations of groups or individuals are not tolerated in any circumstance within the chatroom and, once identified, might result in a ban. 

4. This is a place for informal and inclusive conversation. It is not an opportunity to ask a specific individual to answer arbitrary questions. No one is under investigation.

5. No (concern-)trolling or otherwise incendiary and/or negative comments and narratives. Keep it constructive and positive.

6. No market, price, or “investor” talk. Members can discuss ICOs, investors, or related topics, as long as the goal isn’t to sponsor investment schemes.

7. No constant ranting/complaining. Members may express themselves and vent their frustrations about a topic. However, the frequency of ranting/complaining should not annoy members. 

8. No advertising. 

9. A private group means that all correspondence remains private. It is NOT allowed to take screenshots and spread information from private groups. Leaking private conversations may result in a warning or a ban, as described in the first rule under this heading.

#### Consequences for not following the Private Telegram/Discord Chat Rules

The rules are few, simple, and are generally recognizable as common decency. All participants are expected to uphold them. A majority vote from the core members can ban participants who engage in behavior that violates these rules.

#### Reporting of offenses

If you believe someone in the channel is breaking these rules, you can propose a vote for their removal. However, there must be proof of the offense. No member can be forcibly removed without approval by the majority of the core members.

### Public Telegram/Discord Chat Rules

Moderators for the public channels will be selected from the core DAO members. All items except No. 8 of the Private Telegram/Discord Chat Rules apply to the public channels of the DAO.

#### Consequences for not following the Public Telegram/Discord Chat Rules

The rules are few, simple, and are generally recognizable as common decency. All participants are expected to uphold them.
The moderators of this group will ban participants engaging in behavior that violates these rules. At the moderators’ discretion, a lesser action (such as warning the individual in question) may be taken. Participants, however, should not count on the good grace of the moderators. In particular, where moderators deem it likely that a single individual is using multiple chat monikers to break the CoC repeatedly, bans without warning may be given.

### Amendments to the Code of Conduct 

Any core member can propose changes to the code of conduct by putting a proposition up for a vote in the team Telegram/Discord group. The amendment must be approved by a majority vote (≥50%)  with at least 80% voter turnout (participation).
