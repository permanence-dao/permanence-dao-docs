## Mandate for Open-Source Development

### Introduction

This **mandate** was voted on by members in the internal referendum [PDAO #2 - Mandate for Open-Source Development](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/permanence/proposal/QmYv6MD6sEYkgkDpLhMyf5qKcbvFeGW8PinDuAqZNRVA3M), which **received 9 aye votes and 1 abstain vote from 10 members, and is effective from the 21st of April, 2025**.

### Description

It is **mandatory** for the complete suite of **community- and user-facing** software produced by Permanence DAO to be **developed and maintained as open-source** throughout both the development and release cycles. This is to ensure:

1. **The protection of the community and users** through open and auditable codebases.
2. **Alignment with the ethos of free software, Web3, and cypherpunk values.**
3. **Open access to the knowledge embedded in the code** for any interested developer.

This mandate applies to, but is not limited to:

1. **Chat bots**
2. **Voting automation infrastructure**
3. **Websites**
4. **User-facing software products**

**Current set of tools** developed by the DAO members and used by the DAO are **fully open-source**:

1. **Opensquare** ([Link](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/permanence), [GitHub](https://github.com/opensquare-network/collaboration))
2. **Telegram bot and supporting services** ([GitHub](https://github.com/permanence-dao/permanence-dao-services))
3. **Website** ([Link](https://permanence.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/permanence-dao/permanence-dao-web))
4. **Documentation site** [Link](https://docs.permanence.io/), ([GitHub](https://github.com/permanence-dao/permanence-dao-docs))

**All future software development** is to be carried out in a repository under the DAOâ€™s **official GitHub organisation**, currently at [https://github.com/permanence-dao](https://github.com/permanence-dao).

A **separate proposal** will be submitted to determine the specific **licence types** (e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPLv3) to be applied to different use cases.
