## Membership Mandate

### 1. KYB/KYC Mandate

Any member or organization involved in Permanence DAO will be required to KYC/ KYB for accountability.

### 2. Engage-to-Retain Mandate

Every member or organization must explain their voting decision within a 'reasonable amount of time', which can be defined as within a timeframe that members have a chance to provide feedback before a voting period ends. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a strike against the member, and after three strikes, the member will be removed from the DAO with an option to reapply only after 12 months.

### 3. Delegation Mandate

Core members of Permanence DAO are required delegate the DAO for at least the W3F Decentralized Voices OpenGov delegation tracks, which are all Spender tracks (32, 33, 34), Tipper tracks (30, 31), as well as the Treasurer track (11) and Wish-for-change track (2). A lower limit of 50 DOT total with a minimum conviction of 3x is required at the time of the writing of this mandate. The delegation should be made from an identity-verified account that belongs to the member, or a child account of an identity-verified account.

A grace period of one week will apply to any member who removes their delegation, and the member gets removed at the end of the grace period should they fail to restore their delegation within the grace period.
